## Why Components?

1. Reuseability
   - Don't repeat yourself
2. Separation of Concerns
   - Don't do too many things in one and the same place (function)

## How is a Component Built?

By combining HTML, CSS (least important part), and JavaScript

## What are "props"?

Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes. props stands for properties.
